# LLM Session Starter (Pin This)

Paste this at the top of a new Copilot/LLM chat to keep work on-rails.

## Repo Guardrails (follow strictly)
- Tests: COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_TESTS.md (placement rules, Proposed Test Cases comment, factory fixtures, parametrization ids)
- TDD: COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_TDD.md (Red/Green/Refactor; quality gates: pytest, mypy, ruff)
- Git: COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_GIT_HYGIENE.md (tiny conventional commits; squash vs merge)
- Vibe: COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_VIBE_CODING.md (TDD-first loops; watchers; DoD)

## Constraints
- Start tests-first unless explicitly in a short spike; convert spikes to tests quickly.
- Keep diffs minimal with no speculative features; follow file placement rules.
- After each step, propose a conventional commit message and list the next micro-steps.

## Deliverables per micro-step
- List files to edit and the exact changes (high level), then apply them.
- If adding tests: update Proposed Test Cases (comment), add failing tests only (Red).
- If implementing: minimal src changes to pass (Green), then optional refactor.
- Confirm quality gates: pytest, mypy, ruff (or watchers are green).

## Kickoff Template
"""
Goal: <what weâ€™re building>
Mode: <spike-first | TDD-first>
Scope: <tiny, e.g., add overflow handling in add(a,b)>
Follow: Tests.md, TDD.md, Git Hygiene.md, Vibe Coding.md
Please:
- Propose the tests to add (as Proposed Test Cases comment), then implement failing tests only.
- Implement minimal src changes to pass, then offer a safe refactor.
- Suggest a conventional commit message for each step and any follow-ups.
